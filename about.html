      <p>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Electrical & Electronic Engineering at EPFL, where I've developed interdisciplinary expertise combining robust embedded systems engineering and advanced research into analog computing architectures.</p>

      <p>In my role as Lead System Engineer for the EPFL Xplore Rover, I've engineered the embedded electronics framework for a Mars-inspired rover designed for European Space Agency-sponsored competitions. Central to my work has been architecting a resilient, CRC-hardened SPI and serial communication stack capable of fault-tolerant data exchange under intense electromagnetic interference. Leveraging STM32 and ESP32 microcontrollers, I designed and validated real-time embedded firmware optimized for deterministic and rapid performance. Furthermore, orchestrating subsystem integration across mechanical, software, and autonomy teams—totaling over 120 student engineers—I have ensured seamless interoperability, from sensor acquisition and actuator control to autonomous navigation and scientific data management.</p>

      <p>Parallel to my embedded systems expertise, my research at EPFL’s Laboratory of Wave Engineering has positioned me at the cutting edge of analog computing research for ultra-low-power artificial intelligence. For my bachelor thesis, I conceptualized, designed, and experimentally validated two analog devices: a binary-tunable metasurface at 2.4 GHz, utilizing coupled resonators and PIN-diodes to perform precise electromagnetic phase modulation, and an optical GELU emulator that replicates complex neural activation functions through structured incoherent light and Fresnel transmission optics. These innovations involved intricate electromagnetic modeling through CST finite-element simulations, high-frequency microwave circuit design, rigorous VNA-based experimental characterization, and extensive data analysis in Python and C++.</p>

      <p>Beyond academia, I've engaged in international collaborative research initiatives, including the design and presentation of an environmental sensing platform at the United Nations Geneva Forum. My active involvement in student engineering communities and leadership roles in IEEE-affiliated competitions highlights my ability not only to engineer precise technical solutions but also to effectively communicate complex ideas and lead diverse, interdisciplinary teams.</p>

      <p>I am proficient in embedded software development (C/C++, Rust), electromagnetic simulation (CST), analog and digital hardware design (KiCad), and rigorous automated validation through GitHub Actions and continuous integration frameworks. Fluent in English and French, with conversational proficiency in Spanish, I excel at navigating cross-cultural collaborative environments.</p>
